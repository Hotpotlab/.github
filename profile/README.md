## Welcome to the Hot Pot Lab Team Repo!

We are a group of students/devs working on the YouFlix project for the MIT Bitcoin Expo Hackathon 2023. Our goal is to make Bitcoin Lightning Network easier for companies to onboard for faster payments and subscriptions. We believe that this project will help make it easier for enterprise for BTC transactions, and we are excited to share our project.

Please explore our repo to see our project journey and progress. We have included our project description, development plans, as well as our user stories.
